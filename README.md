# CC Radio Station
*A fun way to blast music within minecraft!*
*By Niko Norwood*

This was writen and tested in the CC:Tweaked minecraft mod and is intended to be used with the mods Speaker blocks. The contained lua script will reach out to this repo and pull songs in order from the Vault playlist. The program needs the names of the files to be `Song<int>.dfpwm` since it starts by calling `Song1.dfpwm` and will increase the number till no file is found. This means if you add songs to the playlist there is no need to restart the program!
