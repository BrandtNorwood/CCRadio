# CC Radio Station
*A fun way to blast music within minecraft!*
*By Niko Norwood*

This was writen and tested in the CC:Tweaked minecraft mod and is intended to be used with the mods Speaker blocks. The contained lua script will reach out to this repo and pull songs in order from the Vault playlist. It currently uses a fixed length and needs the names of the files to be `Song<#>.dfpwm` in computercrafts proprietary dfpwm format. This repo also works to host other files that would normaly be too big to transfer to a Computer Craft terminal
